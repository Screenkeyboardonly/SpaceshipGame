# SpaceshipGame

This is a multiplayer game developed using unity and custom graphics resoures, the server side relies on HLAPI.

- In this game you fly in a spaceship through a space region reminding of "Kuiper belt" you have to fight of enemy battleships, the spaceship is equiped in lasers and a teleport gun that can be aimed at orbiting asteroids, to then add "teleport" movement mechanics for player character if two asteroids were hit and player trespasses through any of the portals created on collision of the projectile.

- Possibility of implementing rechargability of the portal gun dependent on how much light reaches the solar panels (idea. glowing crystals for recharging? Facing the nearest star with the panels for quicker recharging?)
